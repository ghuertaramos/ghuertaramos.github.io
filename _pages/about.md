Work in progress
======
This a  preliminary version of my website. Please  come back soon!

Hi! I'm Guillermo, a Ph.D student at [ENES-Morelia, UNAM](http://www.enesmorelia.unam.mx/). I'm a member of the Plant Evolutionary Ecology Lab from [Silvana Martén-Rodríguez Ph.D](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=8-U0ygsAAAAJ&hl) and the [National Laboratory of Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](http://www.lanase.unam.mx/). 

Research

My broad interest is the analysis of the evolutionary forces driving species diversification. For my doctoral degree, I'm studying how breeding systems have shaped macroevolutionary patterns in morning glories (<i>Ipomoea</i>).
Through my research, I'm trying to integrate phylogenetic comparative methods, niche modelling, and field experiments to assess the processes underlying the origin and extinction of species. I'm also interested in how evolutionary research could predict species responses to the current environmental crysis.

Looking for a postdoc
======
I'm on the final stage of my degree and actively looking for a postdoc, if you know of an opportunity, please let me know!
