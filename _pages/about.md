Work in progress
======
This a  preliminary version of my website. Please  come back soon!


Hi! I'm Guillermo, a Ph.D student at [ENES-Morelia, UNAM](http://www.enesmorelia.unam.mx/) in Mexico. I'm a member of the Plant Evolutionary Ecology Laboratory from [Silvana Martén-Rodríguez Ph.D](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=8-U0ygsAAAAJ&hl) and [National Laboratory of Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](http://www.lanase.unam.mx/). I'm on the final stage of my degree and actively looking for a postdoc, if you know of an opportunity, please let me know!


My research
======
I'm currently studying the macroevolutionary patterns related to the evolution of breeding systems in morning glories (<i>Ipomoea</i>)
